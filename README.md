# trajectory_workshop
Workshop on trajectory following for legged robots. This README has instructions on setting up your computer to run the simulation. It also has the questions for the lab activities. It finally has some brief notes on running your code on the real robots. Tough the teaching assistants will be the ones that facilitate with that, your code will need to have a certain structure that is elaborated on.

## Environment Setup

These are instructions to run the simulation on your own computer.

## Labratory Questions

This is the lab content with guided questions on the activities and trajectories.

## Real Robot Setup

This is what the students need to submit to the teaching assistants to run their code on the real robot.
